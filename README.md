In this competition, you’ll develop a computer vision model that automatically detects helmet impacts that occur on the field. Kick off with a dataset of more than one thousand definitive head impacts from thousands of game images, labeled video from the sidelines and end zones, and player tracking data. This information is sourced from the NFL’s Next Gen Stats (NGS) system, which documents the position, speed, acceleration, and orientation for every player on the field during NFL games.
